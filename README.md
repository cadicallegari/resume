Claudinei Francisco Callegari
======================

I’m an brazilian software engineer graduated at Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paraná. Currently I work at Neoway Business Solutions in Florianopolis, south Brazil. Most of my projects now are based on python programming language for scrapy web data and characters recognition. At Neoway I have been developing on Linux environment and using Docker as a tool of deployment. I also had my first contact with Go where I started contributing in small open source projects.

I have dedicated some years of my life working as Full Stack Developer in a startup called DBA. As a result, I participated in all parts of process, from directly contacting customers to understand their requirements, to web development using Ruby on Rails framework, modeling the database, to testing the application. I was also responsible for the frontend development, so hands on JavaScript (AngularJS) and HTML.

After my graduation I worked in different companies with many technologies. I developed in java for Android applications. I was part of a team to develop a protocol of communication in C language for ARM and 8051 processors. I wrote software in Java, Python and a closed tool to convert files used to share informations between companies and banks.

Apart from my technical skills, I'm a committed professional, with can-do attitude, extremely motivated and someone who enjoys to be part of a team.
